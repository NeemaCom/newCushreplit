Here's a prompt for the AI agent to integrate the concierge service upgrade option, emphasizing the user experience and secure transaction, from a FAANG senior engineer's viewpoint:

## Prompt: Integrate Concierge Service Upgrade Option

**Objective:** Implement a seamless and secure mechanism for users to upgrade to a "Concierge Service" within the existing chatbot (Imisi 2.0) or WhatsApp group integration. This premium add-on provides users with an assigned migration assistant for dedicated support, generating a subscription revenue.

---
### Core Requirements & User Flow:

1.  **Concierge Service Introduction/Promotion:**
    * **Chatbot Integration:** Within the Imisi 2.0 (Gemini) chatbot, design conversational flows to introduce the "Concierge Service" when relevant (e.g., after answering certain questions, or as a direct menu option).
    * **WhatsApp Group (Passive/Reactive):** For users in the free WhatsApp group, the platform should support sending a discreet, secure link or prompt to initiate the upgrade process when explicitly requested or triggered by specific keywords. *Note: Direct transactional interactions within WhatsApp groups are generally not recommended for security and compliance; a secure link to the web platform is preferred.*

2.  **Upgrade Flow & Payment Integration:**
    * **Secure Payment Gateway:** Leverage the existing **Stripe** and/or **Paystack** integrations for processing the **$20 subscription fee**.
    * **Dedicated Upgrade Page/Modal:** Upon user initiation, direct them to a secure, dedicated web page or modal within the Cush platform to:
        * Clearly explain the "Concierge Service" benefits (assigned migration assistant, task assistance, follow-ups).
        * Display the subscription fee and billing cycle ($20/month, $20/year, etc. â€“ *clarify desired frequency if not monthly*).
        * Collect payment information securely via Stripe/Paystack.
        * Provide clear terms of service and cancellation policy.
    * **Confirmation & Onboarding:**
        * Upon successful payment, provide immediate confirmation.
        * Initiate the "Concierge Service" onboarding process: Assign the user to a migration assistant and communicate how they can connect (e.g., direct chat link, email introduction).
        * Update the user's profile status to reflect their "Concierge" subscription.

3.  **Subscription Management:**
    * **Recurring Billing:** Implement recurring billing for the $20 subscription via Stripe/Paystack.
    * **User Management:** Provide users with a self-service option within their Cush profile to:
        * View subscription status.
        * Update payment methods.
        * Cancel their subscription.
    * **Admin Management:** Admins must have the ability to:
        * View all active/inactive concierge subscriptions.
        * Manage (activate/deactivate) assigned migration assistants.
        * Access billing reports.

### FAANG Engineering Principles (Prioritized):

* **Security of Transactions:** Ensure all payment processing adheres strictly to PCI DSS compliance standards. Tokenization of payment data is mandatory.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** The upgrade process must be tightly integrated with existing user authentication. Only authenticated users can upgrade, and their subscription status must control access to concierge features.
* **Atomic Transactions:** Ensure the payment and subscription activation are an atomic operation (either both succeed, or both fail and are rolled back) to prevent inconsistent states.
* **Clear User Consent:** Explicitly obtain user consent for recurring billing before processing any payment.
* **Fault Tolerance & Retries:** Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for payment gateway interactions.
* **Event-Driven Architecture (Recommended):** Consider using events (e.g., `ConciergeSubscriptionActivated`, `PaymentFailed`) to trigger downstream processes like assistant assignment and user notification, ensuring scalability and decoupling.
* **Performance:** The upgrade flow must be fast and responsive, minimizing user friction during the payment process.
* **Auditability:** Comprehensive logging of all subscription events (initiation, payment success/failure, cancellation) for compliance and troubleshooting.
* **Scalability:** The system must scale to handle a growing number of concierge subscribers and associated recurring payments.
