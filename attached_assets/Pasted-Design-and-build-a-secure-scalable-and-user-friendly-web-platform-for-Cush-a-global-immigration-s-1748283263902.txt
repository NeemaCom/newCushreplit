Design and build a secure, scalable, and user-friendly web platform for Cush, a global immigration services provider. Prioritize enterprise-grade security, robust data integrity, and an intuitive user experience. The platform must support multiple user roles, international financial transactions, and integrate advanced AI capabilities.

Core Requirements:
Platform Purpose: Establish Cush as the leading digital platform for global immigration services, encompassing mentorship, advisory, remittances, and loans.

Security First (Non-Negotiable):

Implement industry best practices for data encryption (at rest and in transit) using strong cryptographic standards (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.3).
Utilize a robust authentication and authorization system (e.g., OAuth 2.0, multi-factor authentication (MFA) by default for all user types, especially admins).
Integrate comprehensive input validation and sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
Implement strict access controls based on the principle of least privilege for all user roles.
Ensure regular security audits, penetration testing readiness, and adherence to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection.
Adopt a secure by design approach, meaning security considerations are embedded at every stage of development.
User Management:

User Roles:
Admin: Full control over content, user management, transaction monitoring, and system configuration.
Customers: Access to their profiles, service requests, payment history, virtual wallets, and the AI chatbot.
Account Features: Secure registration process, profile management (including personal details, immigration status, service preferences), and robust account recovery mechanisms.
Financial Transactions:

Transfers: Enable secure money transfers from Nigeria (NGN) to UK Pounds Sterling (GBP).
Payment Gateway Integration: Seamlessly integrate with Stripe for all payment processing, ensuring compliance with PCI DSS standards.
Virtual Wallets: Implement a secure virtual wallet system for customers to hold funds, receive remittances, and manage loan disbursements. Ensure clear audit trails for all wallet transactions.
Key Features:

Registration: Streamlined and secure onboarding for new users.
Profiles: Comprehensive and customizable user profiles for both customers and administrators.
Payments: Intuitive interface for initiating and tracking payments and transfers.
Imisi 2.0 Integration: Seamlessly embed Imisi 2.0 (our AI-powered migration chatbot helper, powered by Gemini) directly into the platform, providing real-time assistance and information. The chatbot should be accessible from key user journey points.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability: The architecture must support rapid growth in user base and transaction volume without performance degradation.
Reliability: High availability and fault tolerance are critical, ensuring minimal downtime.
Performance: Fast loading times and responsive interactions across all devices.
Compliance: Adherence to international financial regulations and immigration laws.
Localization: Capability for future expansion to support multiple languages and currencies.
Observability: Implement robust logging, monitoring, and alerting systems to ensure operational visibility and rapid incident response.
Technical & Architectural Considerations:
Utilize a modern, well-supported technology stack (e.g., React/Next.js for frontend, Node.js/Python for backend with a microservices architecture, cloud-native deployments on AWS/Azure/GCP).
Employ infrastructure as code (IaC) for consistent and secure environment provisioning.
Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with integrated security checks.
Design for loose coupling and high cohesion to facilitate future feature development and maintenance.
