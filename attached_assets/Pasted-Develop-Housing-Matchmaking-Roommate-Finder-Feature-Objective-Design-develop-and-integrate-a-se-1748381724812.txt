Develop Housing Matchmaking & Roommate Finder Feature
Objective: Design, develop, and integrate a secure and scalable "Housing Matchmaking" or "Roommate Finder" feature within the Cush platform. This feature will connect migrants, expatriates, and digital nomads with rental listings or co-living options in their target locations, establishing a clear revenue model.

Core Requirements & Functionality:
User Profiles for Housing:

Tenant Profile: Allow users seeking housing to create detailed profiles including:
Target location(s) (city, neighborhood preferences).
Budget range.
Move-in date.
Housing type preference (e.g., apartment, room in shared house, co-living).
Lifestyle preferences (e.g., quiet, social, pet-friendly, non-smoker).
Optional: Brief bio/description.
Landlord/Host Profile: Allow landlords, property managers, or co-living operators to create profiles for their listings including:
Property type, size, number of rooms.
Location (address, proximity to transport/amenities).
Rent, deposit, and utilities information.
Availability dates.
Amenities (furnished, Wi-Fi, laundry, etc.).
Photos and descriptions.
Matchmaking Logic:

Implement a robust matching algorithm that intelligently connects tenants with suitable listings or potential roommates based on their specified criteria and preferences.
Filters & Search: Provide comprehensive search and filtering options for users to refine their results (e.g., by price, location, amenities, number of bedrooms).
Communication: Facilitate secure, in-platform communication between matched parties (e.g., secure messaging system). Avoid direct display of personal contact information until both parties explicitly agree.
Revenue Model Implementation:

Listing Fee (Landlords/Hosts):
Develop a mechanism for landlords/hosts to pay a fee (one-time or subscription) to list their property on Cush.
Integrate with existing Stripe/Paystack for secure payment processing for listing fees.
Implement clear pricing tiers for listings (e.g., basic, featured, premium).
Access Fee (Tenants - Optional/Considered):
Initially, consider making tenant access free to drive adoption. If implemented, this would involve a one-time or subscription fee for tenants to unlock full communication or advanced search features. (This can be A/B tested later.)
User Experience & Interface:

Intuitive listing creation and management for landlords.
Clear and visually appealing search results for tenants.
Dedicated dashboards for both landlords (to manage listings, view inquiries) and tenants (to track applications, manage saved listings).
Integration of maps (e.g., Google Maps API) for location visualization.
Security & Data Privacy:

Authentication & Authorization: Secure access controls for listing creation, viewing, and communication.
Data Minimization: Only collect necessary information for matchmaking.
Encryption: All user data (profiles, communication) must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
Vetting (Future Consideration): While not for MVP, design for future potential to integrate verification steps for landlords or listings to enhance trust (e.g., email/phone verification, document upload).
Content Moderation: Implement basic tools for reporting inappropriate content or users.
FAANG Engineering Principles (Prioritized):
Scalability: The database schema and API design must support a large volume of listings and user profiles.
Performance: Fast search results and responsive UI, even with extensive filtering.
Auditability: Log all listing creations, modifications, user interactions, and payment transactions.
Extensibility: Design the architecture to easily add new property types, regions, and monetization models in the future.
Compliance: Ensure compliance with local rental laws and data privacy regulations in target countries.
User Trust: Build features that foster trust within the community, especially regarding shared housing.
Abuse Prevention: Implement rate limiting on communication attempts and listing creations to prevent spam or misuse.
Image Handling: Secure and optimized storage and serving of listing images.
